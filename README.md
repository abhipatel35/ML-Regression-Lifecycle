# Machine Learning Project: Complete Lifecycle for Regression Use Case

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive guide to the end-to-end lifecycle of a machine learning project, focusing on solving a regression problem. The project encompasses key stages such as data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

### Key Features

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis.
  - Encode categorical features for modeling.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  - Utilize three regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
  - Evaluate model performance using the R2 score as the evaluation metric.

- **Model Comparison:**
  - Compare the performance of the three models to identify the most suitable for the regression use case.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python Script:**
   - Open and run the Jupyter Notebook/Pycharm to execute the Python script `Regression_UseCase.py` to explore the complete project.

### Project Structure

- `main.py`: Python script with the main project code and Jupiter notebook/ Pycharm code containing the complete project code with explanations.
- `insurance.csv`: Sample dataset for the regression use case.
